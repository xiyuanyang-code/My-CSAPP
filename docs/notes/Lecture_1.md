# CSAPP: Introduction to Computer Systems

> CSAPP 神课启动！

## Course Theme Introduction

- Abstractions are important, but dive deep into the reality for the underlying implementations are also important.

### Detailed Contents

- Floats and Integers: In computer systems, we use a finite representations of things that are potentially infinite in their expansions.

- Assembly Languages: Understanding assembly is the key to machine-level execution models.

- Memory Systems: Random Access Memory is an unphysical abstractions. (About Bugs and Performances.)

- Computers do more than execute programs. (Data IO, Webs)

Previous system courses are builder-centric, but we need the perspective of programmers!
